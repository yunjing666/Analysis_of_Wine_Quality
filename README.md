# Analysis_of_Wine_Quality
This is the class project I completed with two classmates when I was in graduate school.
In this project, we applied machine learning linear regression model to predict white wine quality of “Vinho Verde” with 11 physicochemical factors by using R. 
To obatin the relatively best model, we also boosted model by different approaches including: OLS model, Backwards Stepwise model, Lasso, and Ridge, and compared the RMSE values
of each model. Finally, we improved prediction model from RMSE 0.741 to RMSE 0.723
